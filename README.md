# Melanoma Project

#### Description
Simple project for a web app to predict the probability of whether one should see a doctor to check for a potentially cancerous growth; this prediction is based on training the Microsoft Custom Vision API with images of melanoma growths. Meant as a beginner-friendly project for myself to experiment with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and calling an API while I was at *Hack the North 2018*.
