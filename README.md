# Melanoma Project

Simple project for a web app to predict the probability of whether one should see a doctor to check for a potentially cancerous growth; this prediction is based on definitive images of melanoma growths. Meant as a beginner-friendly project for myself to experiment with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and calling APIs.
